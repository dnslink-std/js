# @dnslink/js

The reference implementation for DNSLink in JavaScript. Tested in Node.js and in the Browser.

## Usage

You can use dnslink both as code and as an CLI tool.

## JavaScript API

Getting started with the dnslink in a jiffy:

```javascript
const dnslink = require('@dnslink/js')

// assumes top-level await
const { links, path, log } = await dnslink('dnslink.dev/abcd?foo=bar')

// `links` is an object containing given links for the different keys
links.ipfs === 'QmTg....yomU'

// The `log` is always an Array and contains a list of log entries
// that were should help to trace back how the linked data was resolved.
Array.isArray(log)

// The `path` is always an Array that may contain a list of paths that
// each link may uses to deep-resolve values. The list is sorted from
// first to last.
path == [{
  pathname: '/abcd',
  search: { foo: ['bar'] }
}]
```

You can also pass a set of options: 

```javascript
let dns = true // Use the system dns service
dns = '1.1.1.1' // DNS server to use
dns = ['1.1.1.1', '1.0.0.1'] // User different servers as fallback
dns = new (require('dns').Resolver)() // Use a custom resolver. This may speed up things if you do many requests

let doh = true // Use one random of https://github.com/martinheidegger/doh-query/blob/main/endpoints.md endpoints
doh = 'google' // Use the "google" endpoint of above list â†‘
doh = 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query' // Use a custom endpoint
doh = ['google', 'cloudflare'] // Use one of two specified endpoints at random

await dnslink('dnslink.dev', {
  signal, // AbortSignal that you can use to abort the request
  timeout: 1000, // (optional) timeout for the operation
  dns, // (optional, default=false) dns can not be used in the browser!
  doh // (optional, default=!dns)
})
```

- Without `dns` and `doh` specified, `doh` will be used as it works both in Node and browsers.
- With `dns` and `doh` specified it will use one mode at random. With that mode it will use one of
    the given "endpoints" for that mode at random.

## Possible log statements

The statements contained in the `log` are all objects. They may be helpful to figure out why dnslink
is not behaving like you expect. Every statement contains the `.code` property that holds the `.code`
property to understand what happened.
Depending on the warnings code the errors may have additional `.entry` property that holds
the problematic TXT entry. A `.reason` property may contain an additional reason for that error to occur.
If redirects are employed or 
Note that the order of the `RESOLVE` and `REDIRECT` entries are relevant, as they are point to the `.domain`
at which previous errors occured. The entries between `RESOLVE` and `REDIRECT` statements however may
be shuffled. These and other codes may additionally contain a `.pathname` and `.search` property,
each containing their contribution to the path.


| `.code`                  | Meaning                                                              | Additional properties               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| RESOLVE                  | This domain name will be used for resolving.                         | `.domain`, (`.pathname`, `.search`) |
| REDIRECT                 | Redirecting away from the specified domain name.                     | `.domain`, (`.pathname`, `.search`) |
| CONFLICT_ENTRY           | Multiple entries for a key were found and an entry has been ignored. | `.entry`                            |
| INVALID_ENTRY            | A TXT entry with `dnslink=` prefix has formatting errors.            | `.entry`, `.reason`                 |
| RECURSIVE_DNSLINK_PREFIX | The hostname requested contains multiple `_dnslink` prefixes.        |                                     |
| UNUSED_ENTRY             | An entry is unused because a redirect overrides it.                  | `.entry`                            |
| ENDLESS_REDIRECT         | Endless DNSLink redirects detected.                                  | `.domain`, (`.pathname`, `.search`) |
| INVALID_REDIRECT         | A given redirect is of invalid format.                               | `.domain`, (`.pathname`, `.search`) |
| TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS       | Too many redirects happend. (max=32 per dnslink spec)                | `.domain`, (`.pathname`, `.search`) |

## Command Line

To use dnslink in the command line you will need Node.js installed. Then
you can install it permanently using `npm i -g @dnslink/js` or run in on-the-fly
using `npx @dnslink/js`.

You can get detailed help for the app by passing a `--help` option at the end:

```
dnslink - resolve dns links in TXT records

USAGE
    dnslink [--help] [--format=json|text|csv] [--key=<key>] [--debug] \
        [--doh[=<server>]] [--dns[=<server>]] <hostname> [...<hostname>]

EXAMPLE
    # Receive the dnslink entries for the dnslink.io domain.
    > dnslink dnslink.io
    /ipfs/QmTgQDr3xNgKBVDVJtyGhopHoxW4EVgpkfbwE4qckxGdyo

    # Receive only the ipfs entry as text for dnslink.io
    > dnslink -k=ipfs dnslink.io
    QmTgQDr3xNgKBVDVJtyGhopHoxW4EVgpkfbwE4qckxGdyo

    # Receive all dnslink entries for multiple domains as csv
    > dnslink -f=csv dnslink.io ipfs.io
    lookup,key,value,path
    "dnslink.io","ipfs","QmTgQDr3xNgKBVDVJtyGhopHoxW4EVgpkfbwE4qckxGdyo",
    "ipfs.io","ipns","website.ipfs.io",

    # Receive ipfs entries for multiple domains as json
    > dnslink -f=json -k=ipfs dnslink.io website.ipfs.io
    [
    {"lookup":"website.ipfs.io","links":{"ipfs":"bafybeiagozluzfopjadeigrjlsmktseozde2xc5prvighob7452imnk76a"},"path":[]}
    ,{"lookup":"dnslink.io","links":{"ipfs":"QmTgQDr3xNgKBVDVJtyGhopHoxW4EVgpkfbwE4qckxGdyo"},"path":[]}
    ]

    # Receive both the result and log and write the output to files
    > dnslink -f=csv -d dnslink.io \
        >dnslink-io.csv \
        2>dnslink-io.log.csv

OPTIONS
    --help, -h        Show this help.
    --version, -v     Show the version of this command.
    --format, -f      Output format json, text or csv (default=json)
    --dns[=<server>]  Specify a dns server to use. If you don't specify a
                      server it will use the system dns service. As server you
                      can specify a domain with port: 1.1.1.1:53
    --doh[=<server>]  Specify a dns-over-https server to use. If you don't
                      specify a server it will use one of the doh servers of
                      the doh-query implementation[1]. You can specify a server
                      either by the  doh-query name (e.g. cloudflare) or as an
                      url: https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query
    --debug, -d       Render log output to stderr in the specified format.
    --key, -k         Only render one particular dnslink key.

NOTE
    If you specify multiple --doh or --dns endpoints, it will at random
    choose either dns or doh as basic mode of operation and use the given
    endpoints for that mode at random.
