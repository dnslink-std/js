# @dnslink/js

The reference implementation for DNSLink in JavaScript. Tested in Node.js and in the Browser.

## Usage

You can use dnslink both as code and as an CLI tool.

## JavaScript API

Getting started with the dnslink in a jiffy:

```javascript
const dnslink = require('@dnslink/js')

// assumes top-level await
const { found, warnings } = await dnslink('dnslink.dev')

// `found` is an object containing given "links" for the different keys
found.ipfs === 'QmTg....yomU'

// The "warnings" is always an Array and may contain a list of warnings (misconfiguration)
// that were found while resolving the linked data.
Array.isArray(warnings)
```

You can also pass a set of options: 

```javascript
let dns = true // Use the system dns service
dns = '1.1.1.1' // DNS server to use
dns = ['1.1.1.1', '1.0.0.1'] // User different servers as fallback
dns = new (require('dns').Resolver)() // Use a custom resolver. This may speed up things if you do many requests

let doh = true // Use one random of https://github.com/martinheidegger/doh-query/blob/main/endpoints.md endpoints
doh = 'google' // Use the "google" endpoint of above list â†‘
doh = 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query' // Use a custom endpoint
doh = ['google', 'cloudflare'] // Use one of two specified endpoints at random

await dnslink('dnslink.dev', {
  signal, // AbortSignal that you can use to abort the request
  timeout: 1000, // (optional) timeout for the operation
  dns, // (optional, default=false) dns can not be used in the browser!
  doh // (optional, default=!dns)
})
```

- Without `dns` and `doh` specified, `doh` will be used as it works both in Node and browsers.
- With `dns` and `doh` specified it will use one mode at random. With that mode it will use one of
    the given "endpoints" for that mode at random.

## Possible warnings

The warnings contained in the `warnings` result are all objects. They may be helpful to figure out why
dnslink is not behaving like you expect. Every warning contains the `.domain` property that holds the
domain where the problem occured (for the case of redirects) and a `.code` property to understand what
happened. Depending on the warnings code the errors may have additional `.entry` property that holds
the problematic TXT entry. For Redirect errors, a `.chain` property may holds the dnslink redirect
domains that were used. A `.reason` property may contain an additional reason for that error to occur.

| `.code`                  | Meaning                                                              | Additional properties |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| CONFLICT_ENTRY           | Multiple entries for a key were found and an entry has been ignored. | `.entry`              |
| INVALID_ENTRY            | A TXT entry with `dnslink=` prefix has formatting errors.            | `.entry`, `.reason`   |
| RECURSIVE_DNSLINK_PREFIX | The hostname requested contains multiple `_dnslink` prefixes.        |                       |
| UNUSED_ENTRY             | An entry is unused because a redirect overrides it.                  | `.entry`              |
| ENDLESS_REDIRECT         | Endless DNSLink redirects detected.                                  | `.chain`              |
| INVALID_REDIRECT         | A given redirect is of invalid format.                               | `.chain`              |
| TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS       | Too many redirects happend. (max=32 per dnslink spec)                | `.chain`              |

## Command Line

To use dnslink in the command line you will need Node.js installed. Then
you can install it permanently using `npm i -g @dnslink/js` or run in on-the-fly
using `npx @dnslink/js`.

You can get detailed help for the app by passing a `--help` option at the end:

```
dnslink [--help] [--format=json|text|csv] [--dns[=<server>]] \
    [--doh[=<server>]] [--key=<key>] [--no-errors] \
    <hostname>|--hostname=<hostname>

Usage:

# Receive the dnslink entries for the dnslink.io domain.
dnslink dnslink.io

# Receive only the ipfs entry as text for dnslink.io
dnslink -o=text -k=ipfs dnslink.io

# Receive both the result and errors and 
dnslink -o=csv -d dnslink.io >dnslink-io.csv 2>dnslink-io_err.csv


Options:

--help, -h, help  Show this help.
--version, -v     Show the version of this command.
--format, -f      Output format json, text or csv (default=json)
--dns[=<server>]  Specify a dns server to use. If you don't specify a server
                  it will use the system dns service. As server you can specify
                  a domain with port: 1.1.1.1:53
--doh[=<server>]  Specify a dns-over-https server to use. If you don't specify
                  a server it will use one of the doh servers of the doh-query
                  implementation[1]. You can specify a server either by the 
                  doh-query name (e.g. cloudflare) or as an url:
                  https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query
--debug, -d       Render errors to stderr
--key, -k         Only render one particular dnslink key.

Note: If you specify multiple --doh or --dns endpoints, it will at random
choose either dns or doh as basic mode of operation and use the given endpoints
for that mode at random.
